## ‚≠ê Abstract

Medical image segmentation (MIS) is crucial in improving clinical diagnostic accuracy and reducing the risk of misdiagnosis. However, it still faces two major challenges. On the one hand, co-occurrence phenomena often occur in medical image processing, which can cause noise interference and make the model unable to distinguish between target features and co-occurrence interference information, resulting in model segmentation errors. On the other hand, fuzzy boundaries and low contrast are commonly present in medical images, and irregular and blurry edge information can lead to unclear edge segmentation. To address these challenges, we propose a universal framework called Multi-Frequency and Multi-Scale Medical Image Segmentation (MFS-Net), which is based on the U-Net architecture and innovatively proposed a Dual Branch Feature Fusion Module (DFFM) to extract and fuse multi frequency and multi-scale features separately. Firstly, we designed a Multi Frequency Noise Suppression (MPNS) module that combines attention mechanism with Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), utilizing FFT to optimize the fusion of details and global information in the frequency domain, achieving the optimal fusion of noise suppression and effective features. Secondly, a multi-scale edge enhancement (MSEE) module for fuzzy boundary problems is proposed, which dynamically adjusts the receptive field through deformable convolution and channel space attention mechanism to accurately capture multi-scale edge features. 
Through extensive experiments on four medical image datasets, the most advanced performance of our method is proved, and its progressiveness and universal applicability to various medical image segmentation scenes are proved.
